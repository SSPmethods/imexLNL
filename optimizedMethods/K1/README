This folder contains the methods used in Table 9 in the paper
The methods are named 's's'pex'pe'pim'pi'plin'plinK1
where 's' is the number of stages
'pex' and 'pim' are the nonlinear order p=pim=pex
'plin' is the linear order
e.g. 5s3pe3pi5plinK1 has s=5, p=3, plin=6
These methods are optimized for K=1
